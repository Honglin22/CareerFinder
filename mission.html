		<h1 class="bigFont">Our Mission Is.</h1>
		<p class="font">Our mission as S.T.C.S is to help innovate and advance our public transportation by improving the speed of our trains and <br>
internet connection between them. The current state of our transportation is tremendous <br>
and in order to fix this major problem we need to first get the help of the people who take the subway and take in their feedback.<br>
 The major problems of the subway are the fact that it struggles to be on time and cause less delays.<br>
 Adding the possibilities of internet in the subway is a plus and will benefit everyone.<br>
 Our job as a company is to review these problems and take them into serious consideration to help out the average subway rider. Improving the speed of the trains and upgrading the old ones will help boost transportation and allow less delays.</p>
